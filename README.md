## Usage

To compile the library, run:

```shell
$ cd "path/to/libft" && make
```

or this if you want compile with bonuses

```shell
$ cd "path/to/libft" && make bonus
```

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the required flags:

```shell
-lft -L path/to/libft.a -I path/to/libft.h
```
